            <h2>What is a computer virus?</h2>
                <p> A computer virus is a type of malicious code or program written to alter the way a computer operates and that is designed to spread from one computer to another. <br />
                A virus operates by inserting or attaching itself to a legitimate program or document that supports macros in order to execute its code. <br />
                In the process a virus has the potential to cause unexpected or damaging effects, such as harming the system software by corrupting or destroying data.<br /></p>
                
                <img id = "image1" src="images/computer-virus.jpg" width="400" alt="computer virus"/>
                
                <p> Once a virus has successfully attached to a program, file, or document, the virus will lie dormant until circumstances cause the computer or device to execute its code. <br />
                In order for a virus to infect your computer, you have to run the infected program, which in turn causes the virus code to be executed. <br />
                This means that a virus can remain dormant on your computer, without showing major sings or symptoms. <br />
                However, once the virus infects your computer, the virus can infect other computers on the same network. <br />
                Stealing passwords or data, logging keystrokes, corrupting files, spamming your email contacts, and even taking over your machine are just some of the devastating and irritating things a virus can do.<br /></p>
