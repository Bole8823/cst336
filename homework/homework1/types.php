            <h3>Boot Sector Virus</h3>
            <p>Even though this virus has now become obsolete, it still pops out in one way or the other. 
            This virus got attention when floppy disks were used to boot a computer. 
            In modern computers, this virus could appear on the “Master Boot Record”. </p></br></br>
            
            
            <h3>Web Scripting Virus</h3>
            <p>Similar to the hyperlinks that we used in Microsoft Word, many websites rest on codes to provide engaging content to their users. 
            For example, since the trends of watching videos online have now become very popular – more than 2 Billion Videos are streamed on Facebook every day, these videos also execute a specific code.</p></br></br>
            
            
            <h3>Direct Action Virus</h3>
            <p>Similar to the Vienna virus which shocked computers in 1998, this virus comes into action after you have executed the file. 
            The load is delivered to your computer and the virus becomes active.</p></br></br>
            
            <h3>Polymorphic Virus</h3>
            <p>Polymorphic virus has exploited this limitation beautifully as it changes its code every time the infected file is executed. 
            Thus, it becomes nearly impossible for any ordinary antivirus to track it down.</p></br></br>
